<h1>Hello World! This is where I keep my projects alive.</h1>
<p>Most of my projects are from tutorials .  I started learning Javascript and C#, but it was really dry
  and was easy to get distracted with so many paths to take.  It was like watching a tv series that never ended.  Then I found app development to be
  like a movie where once I dedicate a few hours and I would have a working prototype.</p>
  <p> So now I am interested in end to end DEVOPS, since there is still a long way to go, I want to jump in and see
    how big of a splash I can make.</p>
  
  <p> These are the project scripts you can check out at https://github.com/prashant153.</p>
